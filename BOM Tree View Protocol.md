* Now getting started with the CAD Link Programming Challenge, also known as the QBuild Challenge
* As far as I understand it, the objective of this challenge is to build a desktop applications that imports and fuses the two files `bom.csv` and `part.csv` into a Database (ideally MS Access or SQL Server) and displays the imported data in a tree view.
  * In addition, when an item in the tree view is selected, information about the component parts of whatever part is currently selected in the tree view should be displayed in a table view that holds the following columns:
    * COMPONENT_NAME
    * PART_NUMBER
    * TITLE
    * QUANTITY
    * TYPE
    * ITEM
    * MATERIAL
  * The import should be performed by means of a "Populate Data" button that con only be clicked once and will then be disabled once the import is complete
* This is quite complex, and the main issue is that I haven't done an UI-Application in C# yet as far as I remember
* So, first I want to see if I can find a tutorial for how to create a Tree View in C#
  * This might be a good place to start:
    * https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/treeview-control-in-C-Sharp/
      * Unfortunately, I am unable to follow this tutorial past the first code sample, since it starts talking about some code without specifying where that code is supposed to be located
  * Maybe this will be better?
    * https://www.dotnetperls.com/treeview
      * **SUCCESS**: Using this tutorial I now managed to create my first, tentative working TreeView, and I am already getting ideas for how I can use this for the project
  * I am now spending some time experimenting with the tree view to get a good feeling for how it works and how I can populate it with data from a source
  * I have now gotten to a point where I feel reasonably comfortable in dealing with the Tree View
* I figure it makes sense to use this as a base to try and add the table view too
  * Let's see if I can find a good tutorial on this here
  * Since I had a good experience with dotnetperls, why not try this one?
    * https://www.dotnetperls.com/datatable
      * **SUCCESS:** Using this tutorial I now managed to add a Table View, and already have a relatively good idea of how to populate it using the children data
  * Experimenting with this, I now managed to create logic that displays the children of whatever character is selected in the data table
* This is as far as I'm getting with this today

* Now continuing with this

* Last time I created a test view for displaying a TreeView and a TableView that is structurally more or less identical to the UI requested in the project - at least from a UI perspective

* Now, I'll start with the actual project

* Because it's so similar and the above test project is effectively free of dead weight, I'll start by copying over the test project and then making adjustments as necessary
  * Visual Studio did not make this easy, but I managed to do it after all
  
* So, the first thing I now want to do is to change the Game Character sample data structure into one that can hold the BOM

* So for that, I'll first analyze the `bom.csv` and `part.csv` files to get an idea of which fields this data structure will need
  * The `bom.csv` is effectively defining the tree view. All it contains are parent-child relationships with specifications of how many of a child exist within a parent
    * The `VALVE` is implicitly defined as the top-level element since it has no parent
    * Apart from that, one interesting property to import from this file would be the `QUANTITY`
    
  * The `part.csv` effectively contains all the remaining information for all of the parts, namely:
  
    * NAME (this is the equivalent of the COMPONENT_NAME column in the `bom.csv`)
    * TYPE
    * ITEM
    * PART_NUMBER
    * TITLE
    * MATERIAL
  
  * As such, I think the `BomEntry`-class (how I'm probably going to call it) should hold these fields:
  
    * ````
      string ComponentName
      string ParentName
      int Quantity
      string Type
      string Item
      string PartNumber
      string Title
      string Material
      List<BomEntry> Children
      ````
  
    * Optionally, the Type might be implemented as an Enum, and I could probably also add an `BomEntry Parent` link, but I currently don't see the effective use of these things, so I'll just keep it in mind for later
  
* Next, I'll re-create the data structure and use dummy-data to make sure it is displayed correctly

  * According to the `QBuild Developer Programming Challenge.docx`, the Children-Table should display the following columns:
    * COMPONENT_NAME
    * PART_NUMBER
    * TITLE
    * QUANTITY
    * TYPE
    * ITEM
    * MATERIAL
