* Now getting started with the CAD Link Programming Challenge, also known as the QBuild Challenge
* As far as I understand it, the objective of this challenge is to build a desktop applications that imports and fuses the two files `bom.csv` and `part.csv` into a Database (ideally MS Access or SQL Server) and displays the imported data in a tree view.
  * In addition, when an item in the tree view is selected, information about the component parts of whatever part is currently selected in the tree view should be displayed in a table view that holds the following columns:
    * COMPONENT_NAME
    * PART_NUMBER
    * TITLE
    * QUANTITY
    * TYPE
    * ITEM
    * MATERIAL
  * The import should be performed by means of a "Populate Data" button that con only be clicked once and will then be disabled once the import is complete
* This is quite complex, and the main issue is that I haven't done an UI-Application in C# yet as far as I remember
* So, first I want to see if I can find a tutorial for how to create a Tree View in C#
  * This might be a good place to start:
    * https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/treeview-control-in-C-Sharp/
      * Unfortunately, I am unable to follow this tutorial past the first code sample, since it starts talking about some code without specifying where that code is supposed to be located
  * Maybe this will be better?
    * https://www.dotnetperls.com/treeview
      * **SUCCESS**: Using this tutorial I now managed to create my first, tentative working TreeView, and I am already getting ideas for how I can use this for the project
  * I am now spending some time experimenting with the tree view to get a good feeling for how it works and how I can populate it with data from a source
  * I have now gotten to a point where I feel reasonably comfortable in dealing with the Tree View
* I figure it makes sense to use this as a base to try and add the table view too
  * Let's see if I can find a good tutorial on this here
  * Since I had a good experience with dotnetperls, why not try this one?
    * https://www.dotnetperls.com/datatable
      * **SUCCESS:** Using this tutorial I now managed to add a Table View, and already have a relatively good idea of how to populate it using the children data
  * Experimenting with this, I now managed to create logic that displays the children of whatever character is selected in the data table
* This is as far as I'm getting with this today
* Elapsed time: ~3 hours

* Now continuing with this

* Last time I created a test view for displaying a TreeView and a TableView that is structurally more or less identical to the UI requested in the project - at least from a UI perspective

* Now, I'll start with the actual project

* Because it's so similar and the above test project is effectively free of dead weight, I'll start by copying over the test project and then making adjustments as necessary
  * Visual Studio did not make this easy, but I managed to do it after all
  
* So, the first thing I now want to do is to change the Game Character sample data structure into one that can hold the BOM

* So for that, I'll first analyze the `bom.csv` and `part.csv` files to get an idea of which fields this data structure will need
  * The `bom.csv` is effectively defining the tree view. All it contains are parent-child relationships with specifications of how many of a child exist within a parent
    * The `VALVE` is implicitly defined as the top-level element since it has no parent
    * Apart from that, one interesting property to import from this file would be the `QUANTITY`
    
  * The `part.csv` effectively contains all the remaining information for all of the parts, namely:
  
    * NAME (this is the equivalent of the COMPONENT_NAME column in the `bom.csv`)
    * TYPE
    * ITEM
    * PART_NUMBER
    * TITLE
    * MATERIAL
  
  * As such, I think the `BomEntry`-class (how I'm probably going to call it) should hold these fields:
  
    * ````
      string ComponentName
      string ParentName
      int Quantity
      string Type
      string Item
      string PartNumber
      string Title
      string Material
      List<BomEntry> Children
      ````
  
    * Optionally, the Type might be implemented as an Enum, and I could probably also add an `BomEntry Parent` link, but I currently don't see the effective use of these things, so I'll just keep it in mind for later
  
* Next, I'll re-create the data structure and use dummy-data to make sure it is displayed correctly

  * According to the `QBuild Developer Programming Challenge.docx`, the Children-Table should display the following columns:
    * COMPONENT_NAME
    * PART_NUMBER
    * TITLE
    * QUANTITY
    * TYPE
    * ITEM
    * MATERIAL
  * I now finished creating a small dummy data-structure and was able to confirm that this results in the desired data being displayed
  * I also played around with the UI a bit until I came up with something that will do for now

* Next, I'm going to add the buttons for importing data and exiting from the application

  * I'll start with the exit button first since that one is easier, and that way I won't risk forgetting it later
    * As expected, this was straightforward and easy
  * Next, the import button
    * This is going to be more complicated since I'll first have to write the importer  
      * I realize that I'll effectively have to create three "Importers" here, along with probably some interim classes to keep it all clean:
        * One `BomImporter` to import the `bom.csv`
          * This will create a list of `BomBaseEntry`
        * One `PartImporter` to import the `part.csv`
          * This will create a list of `PartBaseEntry`
        * One `CombinedImporter` to combine both imports into a `BomEntry`
      * I'll start with the BomImporter
        * Since CSV import is something pretty basic I'm sure there'll be some utilities for this already, so I'll look for a tutorial on that
          * Maybe this one will help?
            * https://zetcode.com/csharp/csv/
              * The problem with this one is that the CsvHelper used inside is apparently an external resource
              * However, since I will need external resources at the latest when I add a database, I suppose I'll have to figure out how to use these anyway, so might as well do that now
                * So, apparently the Gradle-Equivalent to JAva in C# is NuGet (I remember dealing with that before when I worked for Netfira), and the page for the CsvHelper there is: https://www.nuget.org/packages/CsvHelper/
                  * I also note that the CsvHelper has 53,703,318 downloads, so odds are that this is a good package to work with 
                * Now I just need to figure out what the equivalent for the `buidl.gradle` is with NuGet
                  * It says here (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files) that I can simply add a package reference in my project file using an XML syntax, but I can't find a single XML file in the whole project
                  * Ah, I figured it out. What you need to do is right-click on "References" and then click "Manage NuGet Packages"
                    * Actually, it feels like I already did this, but that was many years ago
              * At any rate, now I have the CsvHelper package successfully imported and have learned/remembered how to add additional packages if I need them
              * Using this tutorial I now managed to set up the importers for the `bom.csv` and the `part.csv`
              * However, I do not yet know if they work as intended
              * This is where tests come in! Thus far my code was missing those anyway, so I'm looking forward to adding a few tests to ascertain that the imports work as intended
  
* This is as far as I'm getting today

* Elapsed time today: ~3 hours

* Total elapsed time: ~6 hours
